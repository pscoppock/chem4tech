# chem4tech

This project aims to package a college General Chemistry course
for IT students.

Jupyter notebook will be drafted to conform to [Chemistry (2ed)]
(https://openstax.org/details/books/chemistry-2e) by [Openstax]
(www.openstax.com).

Concepts, exercises, and problems will be illustrated using coding
exercises and projects.

### Things to do
1. Find a way to format all pages automatically, like a stylesheet.  Should these be webpages, instead of jup nbs?
2. Find a way for links to open, not as a new page, but with closing of current page.  Again, common in webpages.
3. Think of aspects of code that particularly fit certain sections, and write an exercise for that.  For eexample, lists work fine for atomic numbers and names of elements.  Dictionaries work nicely for that, too.
4. Find out how to make code-blocks appear in a box.  Probably will be able to find formatting on Stackoverflow, or such.
